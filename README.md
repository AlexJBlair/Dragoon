# Dragoon

Authors: Alex Blair, Preston Stephens
Version: 0.0.1

Dragoon is a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet and inventory management software. This software is small at the moment, but the hope is that anyone can pick up this software and have a way to record one's character stats and inventory with an easy to use system.

Using this software is at your own risk. It may be buggy and it is not finished.
